# Cyber-Security-WebApplication
This project focuses on creating a robust authentication system using the Django framework. The objective is to develop a secure web application by deliberately introducing vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and then applying secure development principles to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

The first phase involves building the authentication system using Django's built-in features and libraries. This includes implementing user registration, login, and password recovery functionalities. Strong access controls are implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive areas of the website.

To test the security of the application, deliberate vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and XSS, are introduced. SQL injection involves exploiting weaknesses in the application's database queries, while XSS exploits occur when user input is not properly sanitized and allows malicious code execution. By simulating these vulnerabilities, the project aims to identify potential weaknesses and understand the impact they can have on the application's security.

The next phase focuses on applying secure development principles to address the identified vulnerabilities. This includes implementing input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, measures like output encoding and proper handling of user-generated content are implemented to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, the project emphasizes the implementation of strong access controls and user authentication mechanisms. This includes enforcing password complexity requirements, using secure session management techniques, and employing secure hashing algorithms to protect user passwords. The project also emphasizes the use of secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS, to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

Throughout the development process, best practices for secure coding are followed, such as using parameterized queries, employing the principle of least privilege, and regularly updating dependencies to patch any known security vulnerabilities.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a secure authentication system that can be used as a foundation for building secure web applications. By deliberately introducing and mitigating vulnerabilities, developers can gain valuable insights into common security risks and learn how to build more resilient and secure applications. This project promotes a proactive approach to application security and helps developers understand the importance of secure coding practices in today's threat landscape.
